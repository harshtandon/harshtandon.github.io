<p>Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, Robert Frost</p>

<p>Whose woods these are I think I know.  His house is in the village though;  He will not see me stopping here  To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>

<p>My little horse must think it queer  To stop without a farmhouse near  Between the woods and frozen lake  The darkest evening of the year.</p>

<p>He gives his harness bells a shake  To ask if there is some mistake.  The only other sound&rsquo;s the sweep  Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>

<p>The woods are lovely, dark and deep,  But I have promises to keep,  And miles to go before I sleep,  And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
